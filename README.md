Common ChromeOS Issues. These can be ChromeOS itself or Crostini (Linux)

Reminder this is just an **archive** of common issues faced by ChromeOS users either in the present or in the past.

# Where?
Check the folders above for `md` files that will help you regarding your issues

# Notes
Here are some information you should know:

1. This is dedicated towards issues within ChromeOS itself not with things like "installing another OS"
2. Sometimes there would be times where you would have to contact Google themselves to fix the issue as it might be very specific

# Common Knowledge
If nothing works for you, here are some options:

1. Contact Customer Support ==> Google, etc.
2. Ask for help on the Chromebook Help Website 
3. Powerwash and/or reset the environment you are having trouble with

# Organization Managed Device

If your device is managed by an organization (school, company, etc.), it is best to contact them and ask for both their permissions and help.

# Contribution and Commentations

You can create an issue in the `Issues` tab and post your concern and commentary there.
