# System fans are always on

### Reasons:

1. You are in dev-mode meaning there are some anomalies that can occur, switch back to the regular channel.

2. Use task manager (Search+ESC / Shift+ESC) and kill unnecessary apps (CAREFUL)

3. Offload/remove unnecessary apps and files

4. Do a powerwash

5. Clean your laptop and elevate your laptop so it can get consistent airflow

6. [IF YOU HAVE DEVELOPER MODE ON] Use `ectool` in CROSH (CTRL+ALT+T) to set fanspeed. `sudo ectool fanduty <parameters>`
